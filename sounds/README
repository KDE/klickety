Klickety used KNotify with just two standard KDE sounds.
I ported it to KGameSound but just copied those used
standard KDE sounds into Klickety. Here is what was copied:

KDE-Window-Shade-Down.ogg
-> remove.ogg (used compressor to increase volume)
KDE-Im-User-Auth.ogg
-> game-finished.ogg

Maybe someone wants to create new sounds at some point.
Please remove this file once that happened.
